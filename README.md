# Chess-Engine
Personal chess engine
Implemented all chess logic so the engine is able to generate all legal moves in a position including en passant and pawn promotion.
It is also capable of making and unmaking moves on the board which updates as the moves are being inputted. 
Capable of making moves on its own. Used the chess programming wiki in order to learn and guide my decision making on this project
